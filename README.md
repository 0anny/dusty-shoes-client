# Getting Started with Dusty Shoes

This is a React frontend for a travel app, Dusty Shoes. Fork and clone this repository and run yarn install to get the front end up and going. Fork and clone the backend repository, https://github.com/cmwilson21/dusty-shoes-server, and follow the README.md instructions there to get the back end going.

Once everything is ready, run yarn start to activate the app.

## How to Interact with the App

Login or signup to create an account. Once an account is created, a user will have the options to add a new trip or view a list of trips you want to take. 

Under the Navbar, there is a random city displayed with current temperature. 
Above the footer, there is a random travel quote displayed to help encourage your spirit to travel.
